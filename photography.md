Several of my photos have been featured in publications, garnered awards, and been in juried exhibitions. 

The galleries below are currently offline as Flickr changed its javascript policy and no longer hosts embedded slideshows. I will update these as soon as I find another remote host solution.

I have a small NFT gallery of digital reproductions and original analog prints for sale here: [https://crypto.com/nft/profile/csmarcum](https://crypto.com/nft/profile/csmarcum).
