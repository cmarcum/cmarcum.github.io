## My background things
I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Demographic Analysis (2007) and a Ph.D. (2011) in Sociology from the University of California, Irvine. A mathematical sociologist by training, I served as a research associate in the Networks, Computation, and Social Dynamics Lab at CALIT2 while completing my doctoral research, which focused on how aging and health shapes changes in daily social contact. I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in economics and statistics at the RAND Corporation where I developed mixed mathematical models of influenza vaccination decision behavior using real-world data. 

Shortly after my postdoctoral training I was recruited into the Intramural Research Program at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) as a staff scientist-methodologist. My research, housed since 2013 in the Social Networks Methods Section of the Social and Behavioral Research Branch (SBRB), had two arms: a substantive arm focused on understanding how genetic risk information flows in human social networks and a methodological arm focused on developing, validating, and applying novel approaches to the collection, storage, and analysis of complex dynamical datasets. My service responsibilities at NHGRI included training and mentorship of research fellows, managing lab resources for SBRB, and serving on the Scientific Review and Data Access Committees as the Genomics and Society representative.  

I joined the Office of Data Science and Emerging Technologies at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in 2020 as a detailee. I currently serve as the Genomic Program Administrator and Chair of the Data Access Committee for NIAID. 

Outside of my career, I am an [avid photographer](photography) and nature enthusiast. I enjoy spending time adventuring with my kiddo, Grafton, and our two dogs, Nancy Reagan and Tanner the Mayor.
