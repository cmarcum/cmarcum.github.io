<b>I am a science policy wonk.</b>

My current role is Senior Statistician and Senior Scientist in the White House Office of Management and Budget, Office of the Chief Statistician of the United States. My portfolio focuses on data access, science and information policy, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.  Previously, I served as the Assistant Director for Open Science and Data Policy at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.  In that capacity, I advanced the Biden-Harris Administration priorities on restoring trust in government through scientific integrity and evidence-based policy making and delivering a more equitably accessible return on the American public's investments in Federal research and development through open science and public access.

<summary>Professional Background</summary>
<p>
I hold a master's degree in Demographic Analysis (2007) and a doctorate in Sociology (2011) from the University of California, Irvine. A mathematical sociologist by training, I served as a research associate in the Networks, Computation, and Social Dynamics Lab at CALIT2 while completing my doctoral research, which focused on how <a href="https://osf.io/6bjuw/">aging and health shapes changes in daily social contact</a>. I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in economics and statistics at the RAND Corporation where I developed mixed <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-5474-8_13">mathematical models of influenza vaccination decision behavior</a> using real-world data. 
</p>
<p>
Shortly after my postdoctoral training I was recruited into the <a href="https://irp.nih.gov/blog/post/2019/12/the-social-side-of-health">Intramural Research Program</a> at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) as a staff scientist-methodologist. My research, housed since 2013 in the Social Networks Methods Section of the Social and Behavioral Research Branch (SBRB), had two arms: a substantive arm focused on understanding how <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33777396/">genetic risk information flows in human social networks</a> and a methodological arm focused on developing, validating, and applying novel approaches to the collection, storage, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33025459/">analysis of complex dynamical datasets</a>. My service responsibilities at NHGRI included training and mentorship of research fellows, managing lab resources for SBRB, and serving on the Scientific Review and Data Access Committees as the Genomics and Society representative.  
</p>
<p>
I joined the <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/data-science>Office of Data Science and Emerging Technologies]</a> at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in 2020 as a detailee. I served as the Genomic Program Administrator and Chair of the Data Access Committee for NIAID during my tenure there. 
</p>
<p>
In May of 2021, I was appointed to President Biden's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/06/25/the-biden-administrations-scientific-integrity-task-force-seeks-ideas-from-the-american-people/">Scientific Integrity Fast Track Action Committee</a> to represent the National Institutes of Health. This work is a whole-of-government effort to report on good practices in, and opportunities for, scientific integrity within US Federal government scientific workforce. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy is spearheading this effort per the Presidential Memorandum on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/memorandum-on-restoring-trust-in-government-through-scientific-integrity-and-evidence-based-policymaking/">Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking</a>. Right before the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/01/11/white-house-office-of-science-technology-policy-releases-scientific-integrity-task-force-report/">report was publishe</a>, I joined OSTP to help lead this important work.
</p>

<p>
As the Assistant Director for Open Science and Data Policy in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).  I oversaw transformative science policies that led to the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">2022 OSTP Public Access Memo</a>, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-2023-Framework-for-Federal-Scientific-Integrity-Policy-and-Practice.pdf">2023 Federal Scientific Integrity Framework</a>, and the White House declaring <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-advance-open-and-equitable-research/">2023 as a Year of Open Science</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the Spring of 2023, I joined the career staff of the Office of Management and Budget to serve in joint science and statistical policy roles within the <a href="https://www.statspolicy.gov">Office of the Chief Statistician of the United States.</a>  My portfolio in OMB focuses on data access, science and information policy, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.
